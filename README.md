# BC Transit Data Analysis

This repository includes various files of code that were used for our project with the Broome County Department of Transportation (BC Transit).
Our goal was to use their data to find trends in Binghamton University student ridership during the Fall 2023 semester.

Their data consisted of two types:

1. Student Rider Transactions - a record of each time a student ID was used to board a bus, including information such as date, time, bus number, and route.
  These transactions did NOT include location information of the bus/where the student boarded it.
2. Bus Geo-Location Data - coordinate locations of each bus, logged every 15 seconds while the bus is turned on. Includes date, time, bus number, latitude, & longitude coordinates.
